# ReverseBak Project

This project contains tooling used to investigate the old Betrayal at Krondor MS-DOS game.

## About

ReverseBak is a project focused on reverse engineering the classic MS-DOS game Betrayal at Krondor. The goal is to understand the game's data formats and mechanics to eventually create a highly moddable version in Unity.

## Project Status

The project currently consists of two main components:

### ResourceExtractor
- Converts original game data files to .NET objects
- Exports data as JSON/CSV for analysis
- Development tool with command line interface

### BetrayalAtKrondor
- Works with [Spice86](https://github.com/OpenRakis/Spice86) DOS emulator
- Provides C# overrides for original game functions
- Enables debugging, logging and investigation of game behavior
- Replaces low-level DOS file handling for better control
