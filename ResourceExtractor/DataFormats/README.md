This directory holds descriptions of data formates used in the game.

The format is described in a .ksy file, which is a text file that can be read by the [Kaitai Struct](https://kaitai.io/) compiler to generate a parser in a variety of programming languages.

Kaitai also has an online IDE that can be used to visualize the structure of the data: https://ide.kaitai.io/

Just drag a .ksy file into the left pane and a binary file into the right pane to explore the structure of the data.

These templates are also usable in the Neo Hex Editor.
